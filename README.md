#Blackjack
##What is This Project?
This is a simple GUI that allows you to play blackjack against an automated
dealer. You make a bet, play out a hand, and then choose whether you want to continue
playing or not provided you do not run out of money. Your cards, along with the dealer's cards
are displayed in the middle of the GUI and player decisions and game progression
is handled by user input on buttons on the top and bottom of the screen.
##Environment Requirements
Minimum Java 1.8 required, any IDE should work
##How to Setup & Run This Project
This project should run out of the box. The main game method is located in the `BlackjackGame.java`
file. Running that method will create the window and start the game. Make sure the `CardImages2` folder is located in the root project folder
so that the card images render properly on screen.
